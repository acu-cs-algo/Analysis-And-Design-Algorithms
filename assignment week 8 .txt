Answer:

a)12 solutions
b)16,777,216
c) 40320 ways
Explanation:

A) No two queens on the same square

Placing eight queens on an 8 * 8 chessboard has a total of 92 Separate   solutions but unique 12 solutions

The total no of possible solutions using the computational method is

= 64! / (56! * 8! ) ~ 4:4 * 109

but since there are 12 unique solution out of the 92 therefore

B) No two queens are in the same row

= 8^8 = 16,777,216

C) No two queens are in the same row or in the same column

= 8! = 40320 ways

It will approximately take less than a second for a computer with the capability of checking 10 billion positions per second to find all the solutions
